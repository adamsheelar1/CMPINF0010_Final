Abstract: <br>
Overall there is a lot of data that goes into selecting what is the best neighborhood. Our group decideed to pick our own metrics and they see where the postives and negatives overlap. For thg first data set the metrics that were used to get a sample of bestneighborhoods were overall benfits in dollar value of certain trees in pittsbugh. Airquality benfit was also looked at. For the 2nd data set all fire incidents in the city were looked at and broken down by neighborhood. The neighborhoods that had the least amount were then added to the sample.
